# Express 500 Project

This project is a simple Express application that demonstrates how to respond with a 500 status code. 

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd express-500-project
npm install
```

## Running the Application

To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The application will start on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Triggering a 500 Error

To see the 500 status code in action, navigate to the `/error` route in your browser or use a tool like Postman:

```
http://localhost:3000/error
```

This will intentionally trigger an error and respond with a 500 status code.
